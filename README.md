# Monte-Carlo-simulation-for-asset-pricing-and-risk-estimation
Description: Monte Carlo simulation for asset pricing and risk estimation

This project implements a Monte Carlo simulation framework for asset price dynamics under the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) assumption.  
The model is used to estimate the distribution of future prices and compute risk measures such as Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR).
